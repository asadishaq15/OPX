# Performance Optimizations for ScrollTrigger 3D Website

This document outlines comprehensive performance optimization opportunities for the 3D ScrollTrigger website project. Optimizations are prioritized by impact and grouped by category.

## Rendering & GPU Performance

1. **Implement Level of Detail (LOD)** - Use different geometry complexity based on distance from camera
2. **Frustum Culling** - Only render objects visible in the camera's view frustum  
3. **Occlusion Culling** - Skip rendering objects blocked by other objects
4. **Reduce DPR dynamically** - Lower device pixel ratio on weaker devices (currently mobile-only)
5. **Optimize MeshTransmissionMaterial** - Lower `resolution` (2048→1024) and `samples` (16→8) for glass material
6. **Use instancing for duplicate geometry** - Already partially implemented, extend to more components
7. **Texture atlas creation** - Combine small textures into single atlases
8. **Implement draw call batching** - Group similar materials/geometries

## Particle System Optimizations

9. **Implement particle pooling** - Reuse particle objects instead of creating/destroying
10. **Use GPU-based particles** - Move particle calculations to vertex/compute shaders
11. **Reduce particle counts on mobile** - YellowParticles (300→150), AtmosphericParticles (500→250)
12. **Implement distance-based particle culling** - Don't update particles far from camera
13. **Use point sprites instead of sphere geometry** - For simple particle effects
14. **Batch particle updates** - Update particles in chunks per frame instead of all at once

## Memory Management

15. **Implement geometry disposal** - Clean up unused geometries and materials
16. **Use BufferGeometry everywhere** - Replace any remaining Geometry instances
17. **Implement texture streaming** - Load textures based on proximity/visibility
18. **Memory pooling for temporary objects** - Reuse Vector3, Matrix4, etc.
19. **Compress textures** - Use KTX2/DDS formats for better GPU memory usage
20. **Remove unused model data** - Strip unnecessary vertex attributes from GLB files

## Animation & Frame Rate

21. **Implement frame rate limiting** - Cap at 60fps to prevent overheating
22. **Use RAF-based animation throttling** - Skip frames on slower devices
23. **Optimize scroll calculations** - Cache scroll values and only update when changed
24. **Implement animation culling** - Pause animations for off-screen objects
25. **Use CSS transforms for 2D elements** - Instead of Three.js transforms where possible
26. **Debounce resize handlers** - Prevent excessive re-renders on window resize

## Asset Loading & Bundling

27. **Implement progressive loading** - Load critical assets first, others on demand
28. **Use GLB compression** - Draco/meshopt compression for 3D models
29. **Preload critical assets** - Models and textures needed immediately
30. **Implement asset caching** - Use service worker for offline asset caching
31. **Code splitting by routes** - Split components into separate bundles
32. **Tree shake unused Three.js modules** - Remove unused imports

## CPU Performance

33. **Move calculations to Web Workers** - Heavy math operations off main thread
34. **Implement object pooling** - For frequently created/destroyed objects
35. **Use typed arrays everywhere** - Float32Array instead of regular arrays
36. **Optimize scroll listeners** - Use passive event listeners
37. **Implement spatial partitioning** - Octree/BSP for collision detection
38. **Cache expensive calculations** - Store results of complex math operations

## Shader Optimizations

39. **Use simpler materials where possible** - MeshBasicMaterial instead of complex ones
40. **Implement custom shaders** - Optimized for specific use cases
41. **Reduce shader precision** - Use `mediump` instead of `highp` on mobile
42. **Batch shader uniform updates** - Update multiple objects with same uniforms together

## Network & Loading

43. **Implement lazy loading** - Components load only when needed
44. **Use CDN for assets** - Faster delivery of models/textures
45. **Implement prefetch hints** - Load next section's assets in advance
46. **Optimize bundle size** - Remove unused dependencies and features
47. **Use HTTP/2 push** - Critical assets pushed with initial page load

## Mobile-Specific Optimizations

48. **Detect device capabilities** - Adjust quality based on GPU tier
49. **Implement power-saving mode** - Reduce effects when battery is low
50. **Touch gesture optimization** - Efficient pointer event handling
51. **Thermal throttling detection** - Reduce quality when device overheats
52. **Network-aware loading** - Reduce quality on slow connections

## Current Performance Baseline

The project currently includes some optimizations:
- Dynamic DPR scaling for mobile devices
- Instanced rendering for particles
- Shadows disabled for performance
- Reduced particle counts from original implementation
- Dynamic imports to prevent SSR issues

## Measuring Performance

To track optimization impact:
- Use Chrome DevTools Performance tab
- Monitor FPS with `stats.js`
- Track memory usage in DevTools Memory tab
- Use Lighthouse for overall performance scores
- Test on various device tiers (low, mid, high-end)

## Notes

This list prioritizes optimizations by impact. Start with rendering optimizations (#1-8) and particle system improvements (#9-16) for the biggest performance gains. Each optimization should be implemented incrementally with performance measurements before and after to validate improvements.
